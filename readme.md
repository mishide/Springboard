<h2>Springboard Projects & Capstones</h2>

ðŸ‘€ Overview of folders

<b> Capstone </b>
Supervised Classification of a binomial target.<br>
6 well known classification models are tested with resulting recommendation based on accuracy and what is known about the data and algorithms<br>
Analysis of feature correlations with PCA dimensionality reduction, p-value for H0 test, Tukey's Method for outlier identification, imbalanced data addressed with upsampling<br>
Accuracy measures: AUC ROC, Confusion Matrix, F1, Recall, Precision
<br><br>
<h3> STATISTICS</h3>
<b> Frequentist Inference Statistics</b>
the z-statistic
the t-statistic
the difference and relationship between the two
the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval
how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests

<h3> DATA WRANGLING</h3>
<b>5.1 Data Wrangling JSON:</b>
<br>
Using Python language and data science libraries to clean, analyze, manipulate data contained in multi-nested JSON file "World Bank Project".
