<h2># Springboard Projects</h2>

Projects and Capstones for Springboard's Data Science Career Track - over 500 hours of training and guidance from actual Data Scientists.

Includes use of Python to make API calls, wrangle data contained in JSON data, statistical analysis and visualizations, basic SQL, and Machine Learning


<h3> DATA WRANGLING</h3>
<b>5.1 Data Wrangling JSON:</b>
<br>
Using Python language and data science libraries to clean, analyze, manipulate data contained in multi-nested JSON file "World Bank Project". 
<br><br>
<b>5.3 Data Wrangling SQL:</b>
<br>
Use of SQL to extract and filter data necessary for analysis
<br><br>
<b>5.4 Data Wrangling API:</b>
<br>
API call to Quandl application to retrieve stock market data including the use of transforms and stock market analysis
<br><br>
<h3> STATISTICS</h3>
<b> Frequentist Inference Statistics</b>
the z-statistic
the t-statistic
the difference and relationship between the two
the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval
how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests
Boostrapping
<br><br>
<b>8.3 Bayesian Inference</b>
used PyMC3 to perform Bayesian inference 
<br><br>
>b> Capstone </b>
Supervised Classification of a binomial target including:
Comparison of 6 well known classification models with recommendation based on accuracy and what is known about the data and algorithms
Analysis of feature correlations
p-value for H0 test
Identification of outliers using Tukey's Method, z-score
Addressing imbalanced data using stratified train-test split and upsampling methods
PCA to reduce dimensionality
Accuracy measures: AUC ROC, Confusion Matrix, F1, Recall, Precision
