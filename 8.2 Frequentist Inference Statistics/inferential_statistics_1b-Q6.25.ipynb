    "Welcome to the second Frequentist inference mini-project! Over the course of working on this mini-project and the previous frequentist mini-project, you'll learn the fundamental concepts associated with frequentist inference. The following list includes the topics you will become familiar with as you work through these two mini-projects:\n",
    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate confidence intervals and p-values\n",
    "* how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests"

    "Imagine that a hospital has hired you as their data analyst. An administrator is working on the hospital's business operations plan and needs you to help them answer some business questions. This mini-project, as well as the bootstrap and Bayesian inference mini-projects also found in this unit are designed to illustrate how each of the inferential statistics methods have their uses for different use cases. In this assignment notebook, you're going to use frequentist statistical inference on a data sample to answer the questions:\n",
    "* has the hospital's revenue stream fallen below a key threshold?\n",
    "* are patients with insurance really charged different amounts than those without?\n",
    "Answering that last question with a frequentist approach makes some assumptions, or requires some knowledge, about the two groups. In the next mini-project, you'll use bootstrapping to test that assumption. And in the final mini-project of the unit, you're going to create a model for simulating _individual_ charges (not a sampling distribution) that the hospital can use to model a range of scenarios."

    "We are going to use some data on medical charges obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/easonlai/sample-insurance-claim-prediction-dataset). For the purposes of this exercise, assume the observations are the result of random sampling from our one hospital. Recall in the previous assignment, we introduced the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and how it tells us that the distributions of sample statistics approach a normal distribution as $n$ increases. The amazing thing about this is that it applies to the sampling distributions of statistics that have been calculated from even highly non-normal distributions of data. Remember, also, that hypothesis testing is very much based on making inferences about such sample statistics. You're going to rely heavily on the CLT to apply frequentist (parametric) tests to answer the questions in this notebook."
